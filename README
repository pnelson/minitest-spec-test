Example project to demonstrate my issue with using certain extensions with
minitest-spec-rails.

Steps to reproduce:

1. rails new minitest-spec-test
2. add minitest-spec-rails and minitest-around to :test group in Gemfile
3. bundle update
4. rails generate controller Posts index
5. write test using `around` with spec syntax

If you replace the contents of `test/controllers/posts_controller_test.rb` with
the non-spec syntax, everything works as expected. The issue is something to do
with injecting on `MiniTest::Spec`. This is not specific to `minitest-around`.

# this works fine
require 'test_helper'
require 'minitest/around/unit'

class PostsControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase

  def around
    puts ">>> around (before)"
    yield
    puts ">>> around (after)"
  end

  test "should call around block" do
    get :index
    assert_response :success
  end

end
